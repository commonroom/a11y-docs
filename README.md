# A11y Docs

A11y Docs is a repository of shared knowledge for designers, developers, and accessibility professionals.

## Why?

Digital accessibility can be difficult.

Interpreting the [accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) is one piece of the puzzle. Even learning to maneuver the [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/) site has a steep learning curve. And thatâ€™s to say nothing about learning how to use assistive technologies, what policies and regulations are at play, how to conduct audits and tests, or actually design or develop something using accessible patterns and ARIA.

Designers and developers should have a single, easy-to-reference document for accessibility requirements.

## How?

This project is an attempt to:

- Aggregate a list of general component types
- Define the essential elements that constitute those components
- Provide the functional requirements for designers and developers
- Show example technical techniques, not production ready code
- Suggest usability best practices through usage guidelines
- Detail the expected behavior across assistive technologies and input modalities
